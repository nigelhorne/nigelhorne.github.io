He was born on August 1, 1917 at Fredericton, NB to the late The Reverend Ovid and Pearl (Boyd) Peters. Ralph, who taught for eleven years in a mission trade school in central India and then in schools in Saint John, was a patient teacher and a consummate craftsmanwho liked nothing better than sharing his knowledge and skill. So often he would meet someone who said, "You were my shop teacher Mr. Peters." He was always keenly interested in his family, active in his church, involved with his communityand deeply aware of world issues. He loved to read, to discuss, to listen and to sing and he had an uncanny ability to be able to recall the perfect quote or poem for any occasion. He was conscientious, kind, considerate and he had a wonderful sense of humor. He was a true gentleman in every sense. Ralph is survived by Lorna, his loving wife of 68 years, his oldest son Brian (Danielle) of Mississauga, ON, daughter Linda (David) of Port Moody, BC and youngest son Dale (Lynn)of Saint John; seven grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren and several nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his parents, brother Eric and sister, Phyllis Huestis. He was the last surviving member of his immediate family. At Ralph&apos;s request there will be no visiting. A service celebrating his life will be held on Monday, December 19, 2011 at 10:00 AM at Portland United Church. Interment will be in Ocean View Memorial Gardens in the spring. Arrangements are under the care of Brenan&apos;s Funeral Home, 111 Paradise Row, Saint John (634-7424).
