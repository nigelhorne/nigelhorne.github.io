He was born on August 1, 1917 at Fredericton, NB to the late The Reverend Ovid and Pearl (Boyd) Peters. Ralph, who taught for eleven years in a mission trade school in central India and then in schools in Saint John, was a patient teacher and a consummate craftsman who liked nothing better than sharing his knowledge and skill. So often he would meet someone who said, "You were my shop teacher Mr. Peters." He was always keenly interested in his family, active in his church, involved with his community and deeply aware of world issues. He loved to read, to discuss, to listen and to sing and he had an uncanny ability to be able to recall the perfect quote or poem for any occasion. He was conscientious, kind, considerate and he had a wonderful sense of humor. He was a true gentleman in every sense. Ralph is survived by Lorna, his loving wife of 68 years, his oldest son Brian (Danielle) of Mississauga, ON, daughter Linda (David) of Port Moody, BC and youngest son Dale (Lynn) of Saint John; seven grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren and several nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his parents, brother Eric and sister, Phyllis Huestis. He was the last surviving member of his immediate family. At Ralph&apos;s request there will be no visiting. A service celebrating his life will be held on Monday, December 19, 2011 at 10:00 AM at Portland United Church. Interment will be in Ocean View Memorial Gardens in the spring. Arrangements are under the care of Brenan&apos;s Funeral Home, 111 Paradise Row, Saint John (634-7424). For those who wish, remembrances can be made to the Mission and Service Fund of the United Church of Canada, the Heart and Stroke Foundation or the charity of your choice) and was buried there after Dec 15, 2011 (Ocean View Memorial Gardens).</p><p><span class="citation">3</span></p><h2>Parents</h2><ol><li><a href="I1141.html">Rev Ovid Hutton</a> was born on Jul 12, 1890</li><li><a href="I1164.html">Pearl E</a> was born on Mar 15, 1889</li></ol><h2>Citations</h2><ol><li>1921 Census of Canada Ancestry.com Operations Inc (Marital Status: Single; Relation to Head of House: Son)</li><li>Canada Obituary Collection Ancestry.com Operations Inc</li><li>Canada, Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.</li><li>UK, Outward Passenger Lists, 1890-1960 Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.</li><li>Web: Obituary Daily Times Index, 1995-Current Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.</li></ol><h2>Media</h2><h3>Ralph Peters</h3><a href="img/M3487-Ralph-Peters.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/M3487-Ralph-Peters.jpg" alt="Ralph Peters" width="175" height="259"></a><br><h3>Ralph Peters - birth certificate</h3><a href="img/M3488-Ralph-Peters-birth-certificate.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/M3488-Ralph-Peters-birth-certificate.jpg" alt="Ralph Peters - birth certificate" width="175" height="291"></a><br><h3>Ralph Peters - Lorna MacNabb - marriage certificat</h3><a href="img/M3489-Ralph-Peters-Lorna-MacNabb-marriage-certificat.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/M3489-Ralph-Peters-Lorna-MacNabb-marriage-certificat.jpg" alt="Ralph Peters - Lorna MacNabb - marriage certificat" width="175" height="288"></a><br><h3>1921 Canada Census</h3><a href="img/M3490-1921-Canada-Census.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/M3490-1921-Canada-Census.jpg" alt="1921 Canada Census" width="175" height="107"></a><br><h3>1947 Passenger List</h3><a href="img/M3491-1947-Passenger-List.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/M3491-1947-Passenger-List.jpg" alt="1947 Passenger List" width="175" height="217"></a><br><h3>1954 Passanger List</h3><a href="img/M3492-1954-Passanger-List.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/M3492-1954-Passanger-List.jpg" alt="1954 Passanger List" width="175" height="229"></a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=TNA/BT27/1614000016/00583" target="_blank">Passenger Lists leaving UK 1890-1960 Transcription - TNA-BT27-1614000016-00583</a><br><h2>Family Tree</h2><img src="img/family-tree-I1163.png" width="334" height="401" usemap="#family" alt="Family Tree"><map id="family" name="family"><area shape="rect" id="node1" href="I1141.html" title="Ovid Peters\nb. 12 Jul 1890\nd. 1 Jul 1934" alt="" coords="26,5,124,61"/><area shape="rect" id="node3" href="I1163.html" title="&lt;TABLE&gt;" alt="" coords="81,109,194,299"/><area shape="rect" id="node2" href="I1164.html" title="Pearl Boyd\nb. 15 Mar 1889\nd. 1965" alt="" coords="148,5,252,61"/><area shape="rect" id="node4" href="I1173.html" title="Lorna MacNabb\nb. 8 Apr 1923\nd. 8 Sep 2018" alt="" coords="218,176,328,232"/></map><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css" />
