There is some conjecture, but due the fact that she was housebound as a result of contracting childhood polio, this is more likely than not.</p><p>The Metropolitan Police were recruiting in the 1880s, and two of the recruits were John Charles Cowell (b. 1862 from Ramsgate, joined May 1885) and William Wills (b. 1864 from Everdon, Northamptonshire, joined May 1886. Their reasons for joining were probably that the Met policed the Royal Dockyards at the time, so the Cowell family would have been aware of them, and William Wills had been an agricultural labourer, but had lost both his parents, so was probably looking for afresh start. Both of them completed 25 years service in the same division of the Met.</p><p>At around the same time they both retired (1910 / 1911), John Francis Cowell, b. 1881 Chatham, son of John Charles Cowell, was stationed at Weedon Barracks, Northamptonshire, with the 12th Lancers.</p><p>You can throw a stone from Everdon to Weedon, indeed, William Wills&#39;s mother, Sarah Loveday (b. 1827), was born in Weedon. Sarah had a much older sister, Elizabeth Loveday (b. 1809). Elizabeth married Thomas Kilsby. Their son George (b.1831) married Rosanna Cooper. Their daughter Rosina (b. 1870) was the mother of Ethel Blanche Kilsby (b. 1891). So the assumption is that John Francis had either previously met, or used the opportunity to meet up with the family of his father&#39;s fellow Constable.</p><p>Another possibility for that first meeting is that at the time of the 1911 Census, Ethel Blanche was living with her uncle John Fenwick and her aunt, Sarah Maria at Woolwich, where John Fenwick was an Acting Sergeant Major. Woolwich Arsenal was at that time policed by the Met.</p><p>John Francis and Ethel Blanche were married in March 1914. Their son, John Albert Cowell, was born in November 1914.</p><h2>Media</h2><h3>John Cowell - WWI record</h3><a href="img/John-Cowell-WWI-record.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/John-Cowell-WWI-record.jpg" alt="John Cowell - WWI record" width="175" height="237"></a><br><h3>Northampton Mercury 21-9-1928</h3><a href="img/Northampton-Mercury-21-9-1928.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/Northampton-Mercury-21-9-1928.jpg" alt="Northampton Mercury 21-9-1928" width="175" height="425"></a><br><h3>JohnFrancisCowell</h3><a href="img/JohnFrancisCowell.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/JohnFrancisCowell.jpg" alt="JohnFrancisCowell" width="175" height="233"></a><br><h3>JohnFrancisCowell</h3><h3>Rugby Advertiser 21 September 1928</h3><a href="img/Rugby-Advertiser-21-September-1928.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/Rugby-Advertiser-21-September-1928.jpg" alt="Rugby Advertiser 21 September 1928" width="175" height="278"></a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=bmd/b/1881/3/az/000122/205" target="_blank">England &amp; Wales births 1837-2006 - BMD/B/1881/3/AZ/000122/205</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=bmd/m/1914/1/az/000164/069" target="_blank">England &amp; Wales marriages 1837-2008 - BMD/M/1914/1/AZ/000164/069</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=bmd/d/1928/3/az/000152/100" target="_blank">England &amp; Wales deaths 1837-2007 - BMD/D/1928/3/AZ/000152/100</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=gbc/1891/0007931682" target="_blank">1891 England, Wales &amp; Scotland Census - GBC/1891/0007931682</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=gbc/1901/0008349756" target="_blank">1901 England, Wales &amp; Scotland Census - GBC/1901/0008349756</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=GBC/1911/RG14/34993/0008/27" target="_blank">1911 England, Wales &amp; Scotland Census Transcription - GBC-1911-RG14-34993-0008-27</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=prs/medway/bap/0121059" target="_blank">Kent Baptisms - PRS/MEDWAY/BAP/0121059</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/transcript?id=GBC/1921/RG15/07677/0347/01" target="_blank">1921 Census Of England &amp; Wales - GBC/1921/RG15/07677/0347/01</a><br><h2>Family Tree</h2><img src="img/I1530.png" width="462" height="405" usemap="#family" alt="Family Tree"><map id="family" name="family"><area shape="rect" id="node1" href="I1518.html" title="John Cowell\nb. 10 May 1862\nd. abt Feb 1927" alt="" coords="104,5,231,60"/><area shape="rect" id="node3" href="I1530.html" title="&lt;TABLE&gt;" alt="" coords="177,108,309,297"/><area shape="rect" id="node2" href="I1521.html" title="Emma Mills\nb. 1861\nd. abt Nov 1933" alt="" coords="255,5,384,60"/><area shape="rect" id="node4" href="I1534.html" title="Ethel Kilsby\nb. 20 Mar 1892\nd. 1 Dec 1978" alt="" coords="334,175,457,230"/><area shape="rect" id="node5" href="I1536.html" title="John Albert Cowell\nb. 25 Nov 1914\nd. 25 Dec 1995" alt="" coords="5,345,153,400"/><area shape="rect" id="node6" href="I1537.html" title="Bertram Cowell\nb. 1919\nd. abt May 1921" alt="" coords="178,345,309,400"/><area shape="rect" id="node7" href="I1538.html" title="Lillian Cowell\nb. 9 Nov 1919\nd. 21 Feb 2001" alt="" coords="333,345,455,400"/></map><script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBwb2_9KgPAa0VZU7PRYe_6Yv8qvu2vcjw" async defer type="text/javascript"></script><script>
