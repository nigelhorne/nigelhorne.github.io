In 2014, he lived at Kennedy House, Newcastle Hill, Ramsgate, Kent, England<span class="citation">3</span>. <p>He died on 2 Aug 2014 in Ramsgate<span class="citation">2</span> (from the Isle of Thanet Gazette: A DEVASTATED family have paid tribute to a much-loved son, brother and partner who has died aged just 21. An ambulance was called to the Ramsgate home of Reece Welch at 5pm on Saturday but despite the efforts of paramedics the former Hereson pupil lost his life after suffering a series of heart attacks. Drum-and-bass fan Reece, who shared his Newcastle Hill flat with girlfriend Abi O&apos;Reilly, had been spending the day at home following a night out at a rave on Friday. His mum Michaela Welch, of Nixon Avenue, said the family were still in shock but hearing from Reece&apos;s friends how much they loved him had helped. She said: "I want everyone to come round. It does not matter if they don&apos;t know what to say but so many have been telling me how much they loved him, even when he had been winding them up. "He was a little terror but he had a heart of gold. He could be compulsive with things, he was a perfectionist and he was a risk taker but that made him the person he was. He never did things by halves. "He was a mum&apos;s boy, not clingy, but when he phoned he would always say &apos;love you&apos; at the end. He loved his family, he was a godfather and uncle and not many 20-year-olds have a godson. "He had waited two years to get his flat and when he did he was so happy because he always wanted his own home. "He done it up and he was always cleaning it. He loved cooking too and would make us all dinner. "He was a bit dippy sometimes, like Abi, and he just wanted to be like his brother."; Older siblings Lisa and Aaron Grant, younger sister Toni and Abi said friends, drum and bass, fashion and his family were the things Reece, who had turned 21 in April, loved best. Lisa said: "He was a little joker and so funny. He loved being with his friends, having a party and his raves but he mostly loved his family."; Toni said: "He was really protective."; Aaron added: " He always pushed life to the limits. He walked into people&apos;s lives and he left a print."; Scores of friends have also left messages on Reece&apos;s Facebook page expressing their shock and sorrow at his death. Reece leaves behind his parents Michaela and Tony, siblings Lisa, Aaron and Toni, girlfriend Abi, extended family and many friends.

From <a href="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/thanet/news/cocktail-of-drugs-blamed-for-37539/">www.kentonline.co.uk</a> A Ramsgate drum and bass fan died after he took 15 to 20 pills at an all-night rave in London. An inquest was told Reece Welch, 21, of Kennedy House, Newcastle Hill, died on August 2 last year after attempts to resuscitate him proved futile. He had travelled by train from Ramsgate to The Forum in Kentish Town, with 12 to 15 friends who split up while in the venue. Acting DS Bradley Shingles told the hearing at Margate Magistrates&apos; Court last Tuesday: "We believe Reece travelled by train with a group of a dozen or so friends drinking alcohol and carrying a bag of pink pills. "Between the hours of 10pm and 5am he consumed a number of tablets. "There is no evidence to how many he took but evidence heard today suggests it was between 15 and 20."; "He became agitated, aggressive, he was sweating quite a lot and gradually became more erratic in behaviour" - Josh Coad; Mr Welch arrived back in Ramsgate between 9am and 10am and stayed for a couple of hours with friends Josh Coad and Kate Bevington. At 12.42pm he arrived back at his flat before his mother and girlfriend arrived at 4.50pm. At 5.02pm a call was made to the ambulance service and 10 minutes later the paramedics arrived, followed shortly by the police. Acting DS Shingles said: "When we arrived he was conscious but not able to communicate coherently and is believed to have smashed items around the property beforehand. "After attempts by paramedics he was pronounced deceased at 7.10pm."; Mr Coad told the inquest he would often go to raves with Mr Welch and they would use recreational drugs. He said: "We shared a bottle of vodka between the group on the train and we all knew each other as fans of the drum and bass music scene. "We made our way to the club and Reece had a bag of pink ecstasy pills for his use. I&apos;m guessing there were 20 to 30 pills. "I don&apos;t recall seeing him that much while we were there, only to turn down sharing a bottle of vodka with him in the early hours of the morning. "Back in Ramsgate he was drinking and buzzing from the pills. "He became agitated, aggressive, he was sweating quite a lot and gradually became more erratic in behaviour. "I was still under the influence myself and didn&apos;t know how to react. "I have seen him in a similar state before and he always pulled through &acirc; " I was shocked and saddened to hear of his death. He was my friend and I miss him whenever I walk past his house."; Assistant coroner James Dillon said: "It is plain to me that Reece had some troubled times through his teenage years. He took prescription drugs for ADHD and Asperger&apos;s and oppositional defiant disorder. "But then we heard of a young man who was starting to get his life in order and mature. "He had a history with drugs and smoked cannabis from the age of 14. We have heard evidence that he had access to drugs &acirc; " a bag of pink MDMA pills &acirc; " and we know Reece took a number of those. "He was with a group of friends at a perfectly legal rave event and toxicology evidence shows the presence of MDMA, cocaine and cannabis. "The pathologist said the concentrations are unreliable because of attempts to resuscitate Reece. "Nonetheless results show he was using drugs &acirc; " none were at a lethal level but it is possible for the combination to become fatal. "I agree with the pathologist that the cause of death was consumption of multiple drugs and substances of abuse.").</p><p>.</p><h2>Parents</h2><ol><li><a href="I9.html">David James</a></li><li><a href="I2656.html">Michaela Jayne</a></li></ol><h2>Citations</h2><ol><li>England &amp; Wales, Birth Index: 1916-2005 Online publication - Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008.Original data - General Register Office.
