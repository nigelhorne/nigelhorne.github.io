Olivier could do nothing because he knew if he upset Lew (who had a notoriously short temper) that thespotlight would miss him in future performances. Lew then became Head of Lighting at The Coliseum London but eventually had to give up the work he loved because his eyesight had deteriorated so much. Lew ended up a window cleaner in Margate, he and his wife Beryl had their family at their home in 1953 to watch the Coronation on their 9&quot; television.</p><h2>Media</h2><h3>1963 Kelly&apos;s Thanet Directory</h3><a href="img/1963-Kelly-s-Thanet-Directory.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/1963-Kelly-s-Thanet-Directory.jpg" alt="1963 Kelly's Thanet Directory" width="175" height="16"></a><br><h3>1963 Kelly&apos;s Thanet Directory</h3><h3>Thanet Times - 13 Oct 1987</h3><a href="img/Thanet-Times-13-Oct-1987.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/Thanet-Times-13-Oct-1987.jpg" alt="Thanet Times - 13 Oct 1987" width="175" height="131"></a><br><h3>Lewis George Spratt</h3><a href="img/Lewis-George-Spratt.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/Lewis-George-Spratt.jpg" alt="Lewis George Spratt" width="175" height="208"></a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=TNA/R39/7262/7262G/012/39" target="_blank">1939 Register Transcription - TNA-R39-7262-7262G-012-39</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=BMD/D/1987/10/76404386" target="_blank">England &amp; Wales deaths 1837-2007 Transcription - BMD-D-1987-10-76404386</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=BMD/B/1907/4/AZ/000531/143" target="_blank">England &amp; Wales births 1837-2006 Transcription - BMD-B-1907-4-AZ-000531-143</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=GBC/1911/RG14/04496/0591/3" target="_blank">1911 England, Wales &amp; Scotland Census Transcription - GBC-1911-RG14-04496-0591-3</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=BMD/M/1929/4/AZ/001150/098" target="_blank">England &amp; Wales marriages 1837-2008 Transcription - BMD-M-1929-4-AZ-001150-098</a><br><a href="https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=BMD/M/1945/2/AZ/001363/062" target="_blank">England &amp; Wales marriages 1837-2008 Transcription - BMD-M-1945-2-AZ-001363-062</a><br><h2>Family Tree</h2><img src="img/family-tree-I317.png" width="356" height="407" usemap="#family" alt="Family Tree"><map id="family" name="family"><area shape="rect" id="node1" href="I53.html" title="Leonard Spratt\nb. 9 Sep 1877\nd. 3 Feb 1935" alt="" coords="39,5,140,61"/><area shape="rect" id="node3" href="I317.html" title="&lt;TABLE&gt;" alt="" coords="102,109,218,298"/><area shape="rect" id="node2" href="I320.html" title="Rose Dennett\nb. 23 Jun 1887\nd.
