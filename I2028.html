J. E. Sarjeant Has Answered to Last Muster. Veteran Harness Maker Who Served in Both Mexican and Civil Conflicts. Saw Service in the Hottest Fighting in 1847 and Commanded a Company During the Civil War &acirc; " Was a Brevet Lieutenant Colonel &acirc; " Lived Here Many Years. Captain James E. Sarjeant, of 143 Wells Street, who was widely known among people of the older generations, a veteran of both the Mexican and civil wars and a resident of this city for many years, died Friday night at 5:45 o&apos;clock from a complication of stomach and kidney troubles and the infirmities of old age. Mr. Sarjeant was seventy nine years old. He had been seriously ill since Tuesday of this week. Few men in Allen county have had a more eventful career than Captain James E. Sarjeant. He was born at Canterbury, Kent (England), September 37, 1827, and was one of a family of sixteen children. With his parents, Mr. and Mrs. James Sarjeant, and a brother and sister he came to this country in the early &acirc; &apos;40s. The family settled in Fort Wayne shortly after their arrival in America and Mr. Sarjeant began to learn the harness making trade. He developed into an expert workman, and later in life embarked in business for himself. Mr. Sarjeant was a soldier in the Mexican war, enlisting in 1846 at New Albany in the First Indiana regiment. He served for one year and was actively engaged in the celebrated battles of Matamoras, Monterey and Buena Vista. At the end of his term of service he was honorably discharged and went back to the quiet life of the civilian. Then in 1861 came the outbreaking of the war that threatened the existence of the union, and Mr. Sarjeant, along with thousands of other men in the north, swept with the passionate resolve that the union should not be destroyed, prepared toagain enter military life. He enlisted from Whitley county April 25, 1861, and was made lieutenant of Company E, Seventeenth regiment of Indiana volunteers at Indianapolis. During the war he was in some of the principal battles where heavylosses of life were sustained by the union forces. He was soon made captain of his company. At Chickamauga, Perrysville, and Rolling Forks he did valiant service on the field and, after the battle of Perrysville, was brevetted lieutenant colonel. At the battle of Rolling Forks he was wounded in the knee by the fragment of a bursting shell. Captain Sarjeant, who in later years was fond of telling his experiences and of the many narrow escapes which he and the men under him had in the war, often related how while in battle one day he noticed the simultaneous discharge of a number of shells in the direction of his company, and in a flash his mind dictated the command to lie down. His men in obedience flattened themselves on the earth, thus minimizing the danger that would otherwise have caused the deaths of many. As it was, only seven or eight of the number were killed. In 1863 he was granted an honorary discharge on account of disability and came home to live the life of a private citizen, re-entering the harness business which he had forsaken at the opening of the war. Since the close of the civil war, Captain Sarjeant lived with his family in adjoining parts of the state, at Columbia City, Auburn, and for eight years in Wisconsin. For the past twenty years, however, Fort Wayne has been his home. Capt. Sarjeant was married Sept. 28, 1848, to Miss Margaret Gill, who lived in Whitley county not far from Columbia City. From this union eleven children were born, only two of whom survive &acirc; " Mrs. Henry Meyers, of Cincinnati, O., and Mrs. Mattie Rodwick, of Richmond, Ind. There is also a sister living &acirc; " Mrs. Charlotte Swain, residing at 323 West DeWald street in this city. There are twelve grandchildren, some living in Ohio, some in this state, some in Illinois and some in California. Capt. Sarjeant was a member of the Union Veteran legion and of Sion S. Bass post No. 40, G.A.R. He was quiet and unassuming in manner and not given to making wide acquaintanceships. The time of the funeral has yet not been determined as it is not known when members of the family desiring to attend the services can be present. Interment will be in Lindenwood cemetery) and was buried there at Prairie Grove Cemetery after Jul 6, 1906.</p><p><span class="citation">3</span></p><h2>Parents</h2><ol><li><a href="I1027.html">James</a> was born in 1777</li><li><a href="I253.html">Ann M</a> was born <i>c.</i> 1784</li></ol><h2>Children</h2><ol><li><a href="I2031.html">Alfred</a> was born in 1850</li><li><a href="I2038.html">Charlotte</a> was born <i>c.</i> 1853</li><li><a href="I2039.html">Abner</a> was born <i>c.</i> 1855</li><li><a href="I2032.html">Rebecca J</a> was born <i>c.</i> 1857</li><li><a href="I2033.html">Sarah A</a> was born <i>c.</i> 1857</li><li><a href="I2034.html">Martha J</a> was born <i>c.</i> 1860</li><li><a href="I2035.html">Mahala</a> was born in 1862</li><li><a href="I2036.html">Idella J</a> was born in 1864</li><li><a href="I2037.html">Margaret</a> was born in 1868</li><li><a href="I2040.html">Florence G</a> was born <i>c.</i> 1870</li><li><a href="I2041.html">Rhodie</a> was born <i>c.</i> 1880</li></ol><h2>Citations</h2><ol><li>England Births &amp; Baptisms 1538-1975 - Findmypast</li><li>US Census 1870 - Findmypast (was age 43)</li><li>Find A Grave http://www.findagrave.com</li></ol><h2>Media</h2><h3>James E.
